# Flags:
#     l -> locked, will also work when an input inhibitor (e.g. a lockscreen) is active.
#     r -> release, will trigger on release of a key.
#     c -> click, will trigger on release of a key or button as long as the mouse cursor stays inside binds:drag_threshold.
#     g -> drag, will trigger on release of a key or button as long as the mouse cursor moves outside binds:drag_threshold.
#     o -> longPress, will trigger on long press of a key.
#     e -> repeat, will repeat when held.
#     n -> non-consuming, key/mouse events will be passed to the active window in addition to triggering the dispatcher.
#     m -> mouse, see below.
#     t -> transparent, cannot be shadowed by other binds.
#     i -> ignore mods, will ignore modifiers.
#     s -> separate, will arbitrarily combine keys between each mod/key, see [Keysym combos](#keysym-combos) above.
#     d -> has description, will allow you to write a description for your bind.
#     p -> bypasses the app's requests to inhibit keybinds.
